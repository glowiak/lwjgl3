        <h3>Streaming Compression - Bufferless synchronous API</h3>

        These functions compress data in successive blocks of any size, using previous blocks as dictionary. One key assumption is that previous blocks (up to
        64 KB) remain read-accessible while compressing next blocks. There is an exception for ring buffers, which can be smaller than 64 KB. Ring buffers scenario is automatically detected and handled by LZ4_compress_HC_continue().

        Before starting compression, state must be properly initialized, using #resetStreamHC(). A first "fictional block" can then be designated as initial
        dictionary, using #loadDictHC() (Optional).

        Then, use #compress_HC_continue() to compress each successive block. Previous memory blocks (including initial dictionary when present) must remain
        accessible and unmodified during compression. {@code dst} buffer should be sized to handle worst case scenarios (see #compressBound()), to ensure
        operation success. Because in case of failure, the API does not guarantee context recovery, and context will have to be reset. If {@code dst} buffer
        budget cannot be &ge; #compressBound(), consider using #compress_HC_continue_destSize() instead.

        If, for any reason, previous data block can't be preserved unmodified in memory for next compression block, you can save it to a more stable memory
        space, using #saveDictHC(). Return value of #saveDictHC() is the size of dictionary effectively saved into {@code safeBuffer}.

        This is an experimental API that allows for the efficient use of a static dictionary many times.

        Rather than re-loading the dictionary buffer into a working context before each compression, or copying a pre-loaded dictionary's
        {@code LZ4_streamHC_t} into a working {@code LZ4_streamHC_t}, this function introduces a no-copy setup mechanism, in which the working stream
        references the dictionary stream in-place.

        Several assumptions are made about the state of the dictionary stream. Currently, only streams which have been prepared by #loadDictHC() should be
        expected to work.

        Alternatively, the provided dictionary stream pointer may be #NULL, in which case any existing dictionary stream is unset.

        A dictionary should only be attached to a stream without any history (i.e., a stream that has just been reset).

        The dictionary will remain attached to the working stream only for the current stream session. Calls to {@code LZ4_resetStreamHC(_fast)} will remove
        the dictionary context association from the working stream. The dictionary stream (and source buffer) must remain in-place / accessible / unchanged
